        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Juan Jimenez, I am a business economics major currently attending University of California Riverside. Some hobbies that I enjoy is playing Guitar, playing video games, and overall just talking to people. The video games that I enjoy most are video games that involve team work. I believe that being able to work in a team is more important than being able to work alone. It helps build a relationship between peers, and it also helps people become better team players. A person is willing to do better on work if it is part of a group project than if it is something for themselves. Games that involve cooperation also helps build communication skills between people. Being able to talk to people is one of my strong suits. I do not have a problem with being the first person to initiate conversations. Once of the main reasons that I have become relatively confident when it comes to being able to approach people is because of the video games that involve having to socialize and communicate with people.<br><br>

        In the places that I have worked, I have always tried my best to be the best. I am not afraid of trying out new things. I work best when I work with others. Having people to work with not only makes work more efficient, but it also makes it enjoyable. A social and healthy work place makes for a better work experience. If I am ever confused or not sure what to do at all, I ask for help from others. I would rather ask for help than to get in trouble for doing something wrong. It is never worth doing something wrong when I could have just asked for help.  <br><br>

        Being a leader is a skill that I possess. I know how to help people without coming off as aggressive. A calm leader is more beloved than a rampant one. When people are not being yelled at, they learn easier, and they are also more likely to work harder to impress. Like what I do often, if someone were to come up to me and ask for help on something, I would do my best to explain it as best I can so that they can get a really good understanding and no longer be confused. Another skill that I have is that I am a very reliable person. If a job is needed to be done by the end of the day, you can count on me to do said task. I am a great listener and follower. I am able to pick up new things very easily, though I will not be the best immediately, over time i will become better at it until I am close to perfection. I am not one to give up on a job this is too hard for me. I will keep trying and trying until I finally am able to do it, even if it involves asking for a lot of help. Plus, there are many things that I have not tried, so who know I might come to enjoy and be really good at a difficult task.
